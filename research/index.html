<h2>Genetics of biological invasions</h2>
<p>Biological invasions are one of the main threats to global biodiversity. I am interested on discovering the genetic basis of the evolutionary framework that underlies the successful life history of mosquitofish <i>(Gambusia holbrooki)</i>, as a model of invasive species. <i>G. holbrooki</i> is a small freshwater fish native from the Southeastern coast of North America that was introduced worldwide because it was suggested to help to control mosquito populations and hence to spread diseases such as malaria. To Europe, mosquitofish arrived in 1921 with the documented introduction of only 12 individuals to a pond in Spain. From there it was further introduced to other Mediterranean basins and more eastern countries.  </p>

<p>Genetic data based on microsatellite loci and SNPs indicates that, despite bottlenecks associated to founder events, European mosquitofish populations harbour high levels of genetic diversity. This European populations are structured and display an isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation. Also, alternative mtDNA haplotypes and differential allele frequencies suggested two European colonization routes: the original one registered on historical records and mentioned above, and a more recent one involving populations of Italy and Greece. </p>

<p> High levels of genetic diversity in introduced populations of mosquitofish is surprising because the general theory predicts the opposite (with some remarkable exceptions). In fact populations from Mediterranean Spanish streams had similar levels of genetic diversity than American populations only when compared with the populations suggested as being the sources of the European introduction. Also, these Spanish introduced populations did not appear to have undergone substantial losses of genetic diversity during the invasion process. Additionally, this American sources allocated at the northern range of the natural distribution of the species had been suggested to appear as consequence of postglacial colonization, displaying less genetic diversity for both microsatellite loci and mtDNA haplotypes than southern populations. We have proposed that these populations acted as <i>invasive bridgeheads</i> for the European invasion of mosquitofish, acquiring the evolutionary changes necessary to become invasive in the postglacial colonization process -long before the European invasion -, and  hence spreading easily in new environments once introduced by humans. We therefore believe
that this bridgehead hypothesis could be applied to other invasive species, specially those arising from unstable environments such as post-glacially colonized areas.</p>

<p> Locally, Mediterranean populations of mosquitofish in Spain display high levels of gene flow specially within rivers that contributes to maintain the levels of genetic diversity. On top of that, among river gene flow has been detected in areas of marshland, in which populations from different rivers get connected in seasonal flooding periods. Strikingly, genetic results point to evens of mosquitofish within and among river gene flow in these rivers associated to human-mediated translocations. This artificial gene flow can have great impact in the maintenance or promotion of genetic diversity, allow the species to spread to areas in which it is not yet present, and outcompete endemic species. These activities need to be specificity prohibited, controlled and sanctioned. </p>

  <li><big>Human-mediated perturbations can affect genetic diversity and population structure of invasive species, promoting or obstructing their spread. Analyzing adaptive and neutral variation in mosquitofish populations inhabiting a highly perturbed reservoir (Flix, Ebroi River, Spain), we are studying how human-mediated perturbations such as pollutants and dams affect mosquitofish invasiveness.</big></li>
  
  <li><big>Literature shows that mosquitofish quickly adapt in response to environmental factors such as the presence of predators, salinity and thermal gradients, and pollutants. However, the temporal components of genetic diversity and geographical structure of invasive mosquitofish populations are poorly known. Using a temporal sampling scheme we aim to determine temporal patterns of genetic variation and dispersal of the species. First results point to a relative temporal stability on genetic diversity and population structure, but highly variable patterns of gene flow in short periods of time (1~2 generations). </big></li>

  <li><big>Using genotyping-by-sequencing (RAD-seq) technologies on several populations of mosquitofish, we are studying how the invasion process sculpts the genome of the species by comparing native American and invasive European populations. Preliminary results point to a prominent role of genetic drift in shaping the genome of invaders during the invasive process.</big></li>

  <li><big>Rapid adaptation to new environments has been detected in native areas of distribution of guppy and closely related species. In collaboration with  Bryan Neff & Shawn Gardner (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada) we are studying the hypervariable MHC loci of both native and invasive mosquitofish individuals aiming to detect the role of this rapid evolutionary events on the invasiveness of the species.</li>

<h2>Explaining human population history using ancient DNA </h2>
<p>I am interested in explaining past demographic events that have sculpted the human populations as we know them today. To do so we are using DNA sequencing data from modern populations together with sequences from ancient populations extracted from human remains in archaeological sites by using a combination of population genomics and data modelling via computer simulations.</p>

<p>As part of the BEAN (<i>Bridging the European and Anatolian Neolithic</i>) project I am interested in developing methods to help explain one of the most complex transitions in human evolutionary history: the emergence of agriculture and sedentary life accompanied by an explosive increase in population size, a phenomenon known as the <i>Neolithic Transition.</i> </p>
