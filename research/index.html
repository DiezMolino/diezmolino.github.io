<h2>Genetics of biological invasions</h2>
<p>Biological invasions are one of the main threats to global biodiversity. I am interested on discovering the genetic basis of the evolutionary framework that underlies the successful life history of mosquitofish <i>(Gambusia holbrooki)</i>, as a model of invasive species. <i>G. holbrooki</i> is a small freshwater fish native from the Southeastern coast of North America that was introduced worldwide because it was suggested to help to control mosquito populations and hence to spread diseases such as malaria. To Europe, mosquitofish arrived in 1921 with the documented introduction of only 12 individuals to a pond in Spain. From there it was further introduced to other Mediterranean basins and more eastern countries.  </p>

<p> Genetic data based on microsatellite loci and SNPs indicates that, despite bottlenecks associated to founder events, European mosquitofish populations harbour high levels of genetic diversity. This European populations are structured and display an isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation. Also, alternative mtDNA haplotypes and differential allele frequencies suggested two European colonization routes: the original one registered on historical records and mentioned above, and a more recent one involving populations of Italy and Greece. </p>

<p> High levels of genetic diversity in introduced populations of mosquitofish is surprising because the general theory predicts the opposite (with some remarkable exceptions). In fact populations from Mediterranean Spanish streams had similar levels of genetic diversity than American populations only when compared with the populations suggested as being the sources of the European introduction. Also, these Spanish introduced populations did not appear to have undergone substantial losses of genetic diversity during the invasion process. Additionally, this American sources allocated at the northern range of the natural distribution of the species had been suggested to appear as consequence of postglacial colonization, displaying less genetic diversity for both microsatellite loci and mtDNA haplotypes. We have proposed that these populations acted as <i>invasive bridgeheads</i>for the European invasion of mosquitofish, acquiring the evolutionary changes necessary to become invasive in the postglacial colonization process -long before the European invasion -, and  hence spreading easily in new environments once introduced by humans. </p>

<p> In an ongoing project we are using genotyping-by-sequencing (RAD-seq) technologies on several populations of mosquitofish to study how the invasion process sculpts the genome of the species. I am also analyzing patterns of rapid selection on MHC loci in introduced populations of <i>G. holbrooki</i> using high-throughput sequencing data.</p>
