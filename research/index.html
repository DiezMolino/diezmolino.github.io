<h2>Genetics of biological invasions</h2>
<p>Biological invasions are one of the main threats to global biodiversity. I am interested on discovering the genetic basis of the evolutionary framework that underlies the successful life history of mosquitofish <i>(Gambusia holbrooki)</i>, as a model of invasive species. <i>G. holbrooki</i> is a small freshwater fish native from the Southeastern coast of North America that was introduced worldwide because it was suggested to help to control mosquito populations and hence to spread diseases such as malaria. To Europe, mosquitofish arrived in 1921 with the documented introduction of only 12 individuals to a pond in Spain. From there it was further introduced to other Mediterranean basins and more eastern countries.  </p>

<p> Genetic data based on microsatellite loci indicates that, despite bottlenecks associated to founder events, European mosquitofish populations harbour high levels of genetic diversity. Also, alternative mtDNA haplotypes and differential allele frequencies suggested two European colonization routes: the original one registered on historical records and mentioned above, and a more recent one involving populations of Italy and Greece. </p>

<p> In an ongoing project we are using genotyping-by-sequencing (RAD-seq) technologies on several populations of mosquitofish to study how the invasion process sculpts the genome of the species. I am also analyzing patterns of rapid selection on MHC loci in introduced populations of <i>G. holbrooki</i> using high-throughput sequencing data.</p>


<h2>Explaining human population history using ancient DNA </h2>
<p>Through modeling DNA data retrieved from ancient remains, I investigate past demographic events that shaped the history of human populations in Europe</p>
