CatalansDNA is obviusly a made up company and the whole thing was a joke. It was not a futile exercise however. All over the world ancestry companies like <a href='https://www.23andme.com'>23&Me</a> and <a href='https://www.britainsdna.com/'>BritainsDNA</a> have grown in the last years in paralell to the 'democratization' of the cost of genetic sequencing. For over a hundred pounds they offer to crack down your genetic code identifying your deep genetic ancestry, reveal your mitocondrial and Y-chromosome lineages, and ultimately tell you what percentage of your DNA comes from different regions from around the world. You may think that sort of information is interesting, it could be. The accuracy, precission and value of these tests, however, is greatly questionable. Some colleages nicknamed this kind of analyses as 'genetic astrology'. The nickname is selfexplanable but you can find a LOT more information about it <a href='https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mace-lab/debunking/companies'>here</a>.
