###Day 1

The first thing that suprises the attendant is the obvious magnificence of the venue. The *Hofburg Palace* was built in the 13th century and housed the Habsburg dinasty, rulers during the Austro-Hungarian empire. Once we got inside through a little door on the left hand side of the main door, we discovered how big the conference was. It was Sunday afternoon in a wet and warm day, and there were hundreds of people trying to reach the registration desk. The inaugural conference was starting five minutes later and no one was getting inside without his badge.

After a few nervous moments, a little sweaty wait and some 'heys' to some known faces we made it to the inaugural congerence by Joe Felsenstein. It was ok. Then drinks. A few more 'heys'. A bit of food and drinks and then we reached the highight of the day: beers on an Australian Pub. There were Ian Barnes and Selyna, always fidel to the beer rithual to loosen conversation. Fun.
