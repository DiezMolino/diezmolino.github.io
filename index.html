        		<h1>David Díez (• ◡•) </h1>
				<p>I am interested in the study of animal and human populations through a wide range of mechanisms including population genetics, evolutive biology and computational genomics. For my thesis I have been studying evolutionary processes related to invasive species and their success in novel environments and I have acquired a wide range of skills useful for analyzing population genetics of almost any organism. I am currently involved in discovering the evolutionary processes that have contributed to shape the genomes of invaders and how these populations evolve from native to invaded environments. Nowadays my research is moving towards using genomic tools to investigate the origin and history of European human populations through looking up to their genomes and modelling ancient DNA.</p>
